=========
This is an example to use Contact Form 7 to create a post in any Custom Post Type, and also use CF7 to delete the post checking key in post meta data. I put it together for a custom project.

Instructions
============
I could give instructions, but I understand this code has a really customized use case, and I think you should be able to know how it works for the most part to be able to customize it for your own use. Send me a line if you need a hand. The files are pretty well commented.
